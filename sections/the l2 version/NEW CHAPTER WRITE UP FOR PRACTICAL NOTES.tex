Recall:

\[
\boxed{
\mathsf{Self}
 \triangleq 
\bigl[ 
\underbrace{\mathsf{Skel}}_{\text{coherent simplicial stream}}
 + 
\underbrace{\mathsf{Presence}}_{\text{re\text{-}entry witnesses}}
 + 
\underbrace{\mathsf{Gen}}_{\text{guarded generativity}}
 \bigr]
 \text{ with laws }  \textbf{A1--A4}.
}
\]
\noindent
Intuitively: \textbf{Skeleton} says “there is an orchestra with parts and scores that line up through time”; \textbf{Presence} says “leitmotifs return recognizably after modulations”; \textbf{Generativity} says “the music actually continues, inventing new material without losing the tune.”

\subsection{What this buys you (admissibility, testing, and comparison)}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Admissibility predicate.}
  Define \(\mathrm{Admissible}(\mathsf{Self})  : \equiv  \textbf{A1}\wedge\textbf{A2}\wedge\textbf{A3}\wedge\textbf{A4}\).
  This lets you \emph{type} “good chatbot / strong poem / coherent evolving text” as those (co)algebras that satisfy the four laws.
  \item \textbf{Bisimulation = same persona.}
  Two evolving texts \(\mathsf{Self}_1,\mathsf{Self}_2\) have the \emph{same persona} iff there is a time-indexed family of span maps between their skeletons whose \(\mathrm{Re}\) witnesses commute (up to higher paths).
  That is, persona-equality is a higher bisimulation generated by re-entry.
  \item \textbf{Metrics (optional, empirical).}
  Presence density (frequency of successful \(\mathrm{Re}\)), novelty rate (portion of \(k\)-simplices not in \(\mathrm{im} \iota\)), and coherence budget (extent to which faces/degeneracies commute up to bounded homotopy) let you grade “strong poetry” vs.\ “boring repetition” vs.\ “aimless drift.”
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[2--simplex witness score]
Given three exposures $i,j,k$ with embeddings $v_i,v_j,v_k$, a triangle is
admitted at slice $\tau$ when:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item All three edges $(ij),(jk),(ik)$ are witnessed with weight $W_{xy}\ge \theta_1$.
  \item \emph{Cycle--consistency:}
  \[
    \kappa_{ijk} = 1 - \frac{\|v_i-v_k\|}{\|v_i-v_j\|+\|v_j-v_k\|} \;\;\ge \theta_\triangle,
  \]
  and similarly for the two other routes.
  \item \emph{Non--degeneracy:} the Cayley--Menger area
  \[
    A_{ijk} = \frac{1}{4}\sqrt{
      2(d_{ij}^2d_{ik}^2+d_{ij}^2d_{jk}^2+d_{ik}^2d_{jk}^2)
      - (d_{ij}^4+d_{ik}^4+d_{jk}^4)}
  \]
  with $d_{xy}=\|v_x-v_y\|$, satisfies $A_{ijk}>\varepsilon_\triangle$.
\end{enumerate}
The score is
\[
  T_{ijk}=\min(W_{ij},W_{jk},W_{ik})\cdot \min(\kappa\text{s}),
\]
and the 2--simplex is admitted if $T_{ijk}\ge \Theta_\triangle$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[3--simplex witness score]
Given four exposures $i,j,k,\ell$ with embeddings $v_i,\dots,v_\ell$, a tetrahedron
is admitted when:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item All four triangular faces are admitted 2--simplices.
  \item \emph{Volume non--degeneracy:} the Cayley--Menger determinant
  \[
    V_{ijkl}^2=\frac{1}{288}\det

    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  is positive and $V_{ijkl}>\varepsilon_\tetra$.
  \item \emph{Triple cycle--consistency:} all three routes from $i$ to $\ell$ via
  different faces agree within $\theta_\tetra$.
\end{enumerate}
The score is

    \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  is positive and $\mathrm{Vol}_4>\varepsilon_4$.
  \item \emph{Face--gluing consistency:} every pair of tetrahedral faces meeting
  on a triangle induce compatible barycentric coordinates on that triangle, 
  within tolerance $\theta_4$.
\end{enumerate}
The score is
\[
  \Omega_{ijk\ell m}=\min(H_{\text{faces}})\cdot \mathrm{norm}(\mathrm{Vol}_4),
\]
and the 4--simplex is admitted if $\Omega\ge\Theta_4$.
\end{definition}





\begin{definition}[Rupture and Heal]
For a simplex $\sigma$ (edge, triangle, tetrahedron, or 4--cell) identified by its
vertex set:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \emph{rupture} occurs at slice $\tau$ if $\sigma$ was admitted at
  $\tau-1$ but fails admission at $\tau$ due to:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item loss of a required face (missing witness), or
    \item collapse of area/volume below $\varepsilon$, or
    \item violation of cycle--consistency thresholds.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item A \emph{heal} occurs when $\sigma$ re--enters at $\tau'$ after rupture,
  i.e.\ the missing faces are restored and thresholds satisfied again.
\end{itemize}
We log each event with its cause and the change in witness scores, providing
a temporal ledger of coherence, rupture, and re--entry across skeletons up to
dimension~$4$.
\end{definition}







\subsection{Heuristic and empirical witnessing.}
\medskip

To make rupture/re--entry operational in corpora, we sketch a constructive
protocol. Let each slice $\tau$ be represented by a labeled hypergraph $H_\tau$
whose vertices are Name--exposures and whose hyperedges encode $k$--ary relations
(types, co--references, rhetorical links). Let $W$ be a transport procedure that
matches vertices across $\tau\to\tau'$ using Name trajectories and context
embeddings.

\paragraph{Rupture score.} For a candidate simplex $\sigma_\tau$:
\[
\mathrm{RS}_k(\sigma_\tau,\tau  \to  \tau')   =  
\underbrace{d_{\text{vert}}}_{\text{vertex mismatch}}+
\underbrace{d_{\text{edge}}}_{\text{edge relation drift}}+
\underbrace{d_{\text{coh}}}_{\text{coherence defect}}-
\underbrace{\gamma}_{\text{repairability prior}}
\]
where $d_{\text{coh}}$ estimates horn--filling failure (e.g., boundary commutators,
triangle inequalities in embedding space, or explicit type--checking failure),
and $\gamma$ discounts by available constructive repairs (pre--existing fillers,
schema matches). A simplex \emph{ruptures} if $\mathrm{RS}_k$ exceeds a threshold
tuned on annotated edits.

\paragraph{Re--entry detection.} Maintain a ledger for each $\sigma_\tau$ of
ruptured boundaries. At later slices, attempt a \emph{delayed lifting}:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=2em]
\item Propose a candidate boundary match for the transported faces.
\item Search for a filler consistent with local typing and global coherence.
\item If found, emit $\Reentargs{k}{\sigma_\tau}{\sigma_{\tau''}}$ and record
lag $\ell$ and dimension raise $\Delta k$.
\end{enumerate}
Constructively, the ``search'' is a proof attempt; success yields a term whose size
measures repair cost.

\paragraph{Curvature from edit loops.} For small edit loops
$\tau\to\tau'\to\tau$, compare $\sigma_\tau$ with its twice--transported image.
Non--trivial holonomy correlates with future rupture risk; it is an early warning
for pending creative stress.

\paragraph{Human--interpretable traces.} Each detection emits a minimal
\emph{witness log}: (i) which face failed, (ii) what new filler (or rule) made
re--entry possible, (iii) how much dimension raise was required. These logs are
legible to scholars and model designers and support auditability of evolving
sense in large corpora.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Worked micro--example (chat pivot with explicit repair).}
\medskip

Let $s$ be the speaker, $a$ an intended answer, $b$ a norm (e.g., safety
constraint). At $\tau$ there is a triangle $\Delta(s,a,b)$ filled by
$\kappa: r_2 = r_1\cdot\eta$ encoding: ``the answer $a$ satisfies norm $b$ for
speaker $s$.'' The user pivots topics sharply (edit $e$). Vertices transport to
$s',a',b'$, but the safety check $a'\vDash b'$ fails (no $\eta'$), so the
triangle ruptures. The model issues a meta--move:
\[
\text{``I can’t answer that directly;   here’s a safe alternative $a''$ under $b'$ and why.''}
\]
This constructs a new filler $\kappa': r_2' = r_1'\cdot\eta''$ over $s',a'',b'$
and a path $\Reentargs{2}{\Delta(s,a,b)}{\Delta(s',a'',b')}$ that \emph{records} the
repair (dimension raise: the re--entry is accompanied by an explicit justification
2--cell). The triangle re--enters with creative stress resolved.

\bigskip

\noindent\textbf{Modularity and outlook toward co/holim.}
\medskip

Two technical properties prepare us for the co/holim synthesis at the end of the
chapter:

\paragraph{(A) Local--to--global via homotopy colimits.}
Let $\mathcal{U}$ be a cover of a long edit interval by overlapping windows.
If each window supports re--entry witnesses that agree on overlaps (up to higher
paths), then the global re--entry along the union is computed by the homotopy
colimit of local witnesses. Intuitively: local repairs glue as long as their
margins cohere.

\paragraph{(B) Cores and quotients commute with witnessing.}
Collapsing inessential degeneracies or modding out by definitional equalities
commutes with rupture/re--entry detection: witnesses descend to cores and lift to
quotients, so our later co/holim framing is insensitive to presentational
choices.

\section{What we will need for the experiments}

\subsection*{Formal prerequisites}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item \textbf{Time and continuation.} A concrete finite or $\omega$-chain $(\Time,\le)$ and continuation maps.
\item \textbf{Constellation extraction.} A deterministic procedure producing finite fragments $\Constellation_\tau$.
\item \textbf{Witnesses.} Constructors for \texttt{inc}, \texttt{glue}, \texttt{fill}, \texttt{reenter}, \texttt{retag}, \texttt{drift}.
\item \textbf{Presence/Generativity metrics.} Implement $P_d, N_d$ with tunable $(\lambda,\theta,d)$ and budget $b$.
\item \textbf{Reconstructibility.} A proof/test that the ledger rebuilds $\hocolim_\tau \Constellation_\tau$.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Practical instrumentation (minimal)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.4em]
\item \textbf{Ledger format.} Append-only JSON Lines with stable IDs, content hashes, and face references.
\item \textbf{Windowing.} Sliding $W$ of size $m$ (recency, salience policy).
\item \textbf{Horn detector.} Heuristics from lexical, logical, and structural cues.
\item \textbf{Filler executor.} Routines that turn a chosen horn into text/code that carries the witness.
\item \textbf{Audit tools.} Offline recomputation of $P_d, N_d$, with visualisation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Experimental designs (sketch)}
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item \textbf{Chatbot continuation.} A/B trials with $\lambda\in\{0.2,0.5,0.8\}$; test human preference vs.  $P_1,N_1$.
\item \textbf{Poetic lineage.} Extend a seed motif; measure horns closed at $d=2$ and new images at $d=1$.
\item \textbf{GitHub evolution.} Replay a bugfix series; require explicit \texttt{fill} events linked to failing tests.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Why simplices for bundles? (reprise)}

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item \textbf{Snapshots vs.  witnessed continuation.} Snapshots flatten the proof-objects that cause coherence.
\item \textbf{Imitation vs.  proof-carrying continuation.} Only witnesses make continuation transportable.
\item \textbf{Relational depth.} Many continuations fail by never closing implicit $2$- and $3$-horns.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Outlook}

The intra-Self construction presented here gives a single type--the hocolim of time-indexed constellations--
that captures the algebra of good continuation: skeleton for constancy, presence for local universal closure,
and generativity for non-degenerate growth. The universal property (\cref{thm:self-up}) is the formal summary
of what ``continuation'' buys us: any interpretation that is consistent on slices extends uniquely (up to
homotopy) to the Self. The next chapter inhabits this type over our own logs; Volume II treats co-witnessing.

\section*{Appendix: short operator’s glossary (for the system itself)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1.5em]
\item \textbf{``Continue.''} Choose a small set of open horns in the current window and a small set of novelty seeds;
produce content that fills the horns and grows the diagram; log all witnesses.
\item \textbf{``Re-enter.''} Produce an explicit path (transport, retag, citation) that identifies a new piece with an
earlier theme.
\item \textbf{``Be generative.''} Attach at least one non-degenerate simplex that admits no re-entry from the window.
\item \textbf{``Stay coherent.''} Keep $\Skel$ intact: respect names under substitution and drift; use $\Sigma$-paths
when you must retag.
\end{itemize}
