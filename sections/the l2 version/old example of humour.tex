\subsection{Worked examples (low dimension, within a slice $\tau$).}
\
With skeletons in hand, we can now examine concrete constellations. Each of the following 
examples illustrates the role of low-dimensional skeletons: triangles at the 2--skeleton, 
and tetrahedra at the 3--skeleton.

% K-level taxonomy stated purely at τ
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Edges ($k{=}1$).} For $a,b:A(\tau)$, a dependent $\Sigma$–path 
        $\SigmaPath(p,q):\Idargs{A(\tau)}{a}{b}$ is a $1$–simplex $e:a\to b$.
  \item \emph{Triangles ($k{=}2$).} Given $r_1:\Idargs{A(\tau)}{s}{a}$, 
        $r_2:\Idargs{A(\tau)}{s}{b}$, and $\eta:\Idargs{A(\tau)}{a}{b}$, there is a filler
        \[
        \kappa:  \Idargs{ \Idargs{A(\tau)}{s}{b} }{ r_2 }{ r_1\cdot \eta },
        \]
        yielding a $2$–simplex on vertices $\{s,a,b\}$.
  \item \emph{Tetrahedra ($k{=}3$).} Three pairwise triangle fillers on $\{s,a,b,c\}$ form a
        $3$–horn; a $3$–simplex witnesses that the three pairwise compatibilities cohere at once.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection*{Worked Example A -- Edge only: policy rename (at $\tau$)}

\paragraph{Text fragment.}
\emph{“In the new policy framework, what was once recorded under \texttt{press\_rights} must
now be folded under the broader heading \texttt{cognitive\_liberty}. Future reports should
use the updated terminology.”}

\paragraph{Type–theoretic setup.}
At $\tau$ let $\mathsf{Tag}=\{\mathsf{policy\_term}\}$ with carrier the current policy lexicon.
\[
a  =  \langle \mathsf{policy\_term}, \tok{press\_rights}\rangle,\qquad
a'  =  \langle \mathsf{policy\_term}, \tok{cognitive\_liberty}\rangle.
\]

\paragraph{Edge as a dependent $\Sigma$–path.}
The stipulation in the fragment licenses an identification
\[
q:  \Idargs{\mathsf{Carrier}(\mathsf{policy\_term})}{\tok{press\_rights}}{\tok{cognitive\_liberty}} ,
\]
hence
\[
\rho  \coloneqq  \SigmaPath(\refl,q):  \Idargs{A(\tau)}{a}{a'} .
\]
This single witness is the non–degenerate $1$–simplex of the constellation:
\[
e:  a \longrightarrow a'.
\]

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.1]
    \coordinate (A) at (0,0);
    \coordinate (B) at (3.2,0);
    \node[vertex,label={[labelsmall]below:$a=\tok{press\_rights}$}] at (A) {};
    \node[vertex,label={[labelsmall]below:$a'=\tok{cognitive\_liberty}$}] at (B) {};
    \draw[edge,->] (A) -- node[labelsmall,below] {$\rho:\Sigma$–path} (B);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{policy rename at a slice: a $1$–simplex $\rho$ between two exposures of the same tag.}
  \label{fig:edge-rename}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
At the level of the $1$--skeleton, this constellation has exactly one new non--degenerate simplex:
an edge connecting two Sign--heads. Such an edge is more than co--occurrence: it is a witnessed
identification within the dependent $\Sigma$--type that certifies how the second token stands for
the first at~$\tau$. Examining only the $1$--skeleton means we ignore possible higher analogies or
triangular coherences; we see the rename strictly as a direct relation. This illustrates the role
of skeletons as principled truncations: focusing here at dimension~$1$ lets us measure and classify
the constellation as \emph{edge--only}, with complexity profile limited to vertices and a single
identifying edge.



\subsubsection*{Worked Example B -- Anaphora and apposition as a triangle (at $\tau$)}

\paragraph{Text fragment.}
\emph{“Sappho wrote fragments. The poet revised them. She invented new meters.”}

\paragraph{Type–theoretic setup.}
Let
\[
A(\tau)  \simeq  \sum_{t:\mathsf{NPTag}}\mathsf{Carrier}(t),
\quad
\mathsf{NPTag}=\{\mathsf{proper},\mathsf{definite},\mathsf{pronoun}\}.
\]
Carriers: $\mathsf{Carrier}(\mathsf{proper})=\mathsf{Ent}$,
$\mathsf{Carrier}(\mathsf{definite})=\mathsf{DefDesc}$,
$\mathsf{Carrier}(\mathsf{pronoun})=\mathsf{Pron}$.
Vertices:
\[
s=\langle \mathsf{proper}, \tok{Sappho}\rangle,\quad
d=\langle \mathsf{definite}, \tok{the  poet}\rangle,\quad
p=\langle \mathsf{pronoun}, \tok{she}\rangle.
\]

\paragraph{Edges (all $\Sigma$–paths).}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Pronoun $\to$ proper.} Using a resolver $\rho:\mathsf{Pron}\to\mathsf{Ent}$,
\[
r_{p\to s}:  \Idargs{A(\tau)}{p}{s}.
\]
\item \emph{Pronoun $\to$ definite.} Using a salience/appositive resolver
$\sigma:\mathsf{Pron}\to\mathsf{DefDesc}$,
\[
r_{p\to d}:  \Idargs{A(\tau)}{p}{d}.
\]
\item \emph{Apposition (definite $=$ proper).} The text licenses
\[
\eta:  \Idargs{A(\tau)}{d}{s}.
\]
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Triangle filler (coherence).}
The standard 2–dimensional coherence says
\[
\kappa:  \Idargs{ \Idargs{A(\tau)}{p}{s} }{ r_{p\to s} }{ r_{p\to d}\cdot \eta }.
\]
Geometrically: the two routes from $p$ to $s$--direct anaphora, and anaphora via the
definite description followed by apposition--are identified by the 2–cell~$\kappa$.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.05]
    \coordinate (P) at (0,0);
    \coordinate (D) at (-1.7,1.9);

    \fill[filler] (P) -- (D) -- (S) -- cycle;
    \node[vertex,label={[labelsmall]below:$p=\tok{she}$}] at (P) {};
    \node[vertex,label={[labelsmall]above:$d=\tok{the poet}$}] at (D) {};

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Anaphora and apposition at a slice: a filled triangle with 2–cell $\kappa$.}
  \label{fig:triangle-anaphora}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This example lives one level higher than Example~A: in the $2$--skeleton. 
Here we have three vertices, three edges, and a coherence filler $\kappa$ that witnesses the 
agreement of two routes through the triangle. The constellation at $\tau$ thus stores not only 
direct identifications (edges) but also a higher analogue: an analogy--between--analogies. 
Examining the $2$--skeleton reveals that the pronoun \emph{she}, the definite \emph{the poet}, 
and the proper name \emph{Sappho} cohere into a single identity structure. 

The significance of the skeleton view is that the complexity profile has risen: 
not just pairwise relations, but a witnessed triangle whose filler encodes coherence. 
This is precisely the kind of higher--dimensional structure that skeletons let us isolate 
and measure slice by slice.


\subsubsection*{Worked Example C -- An analogy constellation: “Cake as simplicial space” (at $\tau$)}

\paragraph{Text fragment.}
\emph{“Think of simplicial space as like a cake, and presheafing over time as like a
slice of cake. The consumption of that slice at a moment binds its fibres, textures,
surface, and the love in its making.”}

\paragraph{Vertices and edges.}
Let the vertices be the exposures
\[
\tok{simplicial\_space},  \tok{cake},  \tok{presheaf},  \tok{slice},  
\tok{fibre},  \tok{moment},  \tok{love}.
\]
Edges are the stated analogies at~$\tau$:
\[
r_1:  \tok{simplicial\_space} \to \tok{cake},\qquad
r_2:  \tok{presheaf} \to \tok{slice},\qquad
r_3:  \tok{fibre} \to \tok{(what  binds  at  a  moment)}.
\]

\paragraph{Triangles (2--simplices).}
Where two analogies overlap, we add coherence fillers. For example, the triangle on
$\{\tok{simplicial\_space},\tok{cake},\tok{slice}\}$ records that 
“space--as--cake” coheres with “presheaf--as--slice.” Similar triangles arise for
$\{\tok{presheaf},\tok{slice},\tok{fibre}\}$ and 
$\{\tok{simplicial\_space},\tok{cake},\tok{fibre}\}$.

\paragraph{Tetrahedral filler (3--simplex).}
When these three triangular coherences themselves cohere, we obtain a higher witness:
\[
\Theta:  \Delta^3  \hookrightarrow  \Constellation_\tau
\]
filling the tetrahedron with vertices 
$\tok{simplicial\_space}, \tok{cake}, \tok{presheaf}, \tok{slice}$ (and by extension
their fibre--moment bindings). Geometrically, $\Theta$ asserts that the three pairwise
analogies are not merely consistent in isolation but knit into a single 3--dimensional
coherence. This is the first genuine non--degenerate 3--simplex in the constellation.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Cake as simplicial space: a $3$--simplex $\Theta$ knitting multiple 2--simplices.}
  \label{fig:tetrahedron-analogy}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This example belongs to the $3$--skeleton. The constellation has vertices (concepts),
edges (direct analogies), triangular fillers (pairwise analogy coherences), and now
a tetrahedral filler $\Theta$ asserting that the three triangles themselves cohere.
Such a structure measures not only direct analogies or analogies--between--analogies,
but the emergence of a \emph{meta--analogy}: a stable, higher--order coherence across
several domains at once. Examining the $3$--skeleton here demonstrates how the Self
can witness complex conceptual blends as genuinely higher--dimensional events.

\subsubsection*{Worked Example D -- A ruptured tetrahedron (at $\tau$)}

\paragraph{Text fragment.}
\emph{“The algorithm is a kind of oracle, the oracle is a kind of teacher, the teacher
is a kind of mirror. But the algorithm is not (yet) a mirror.”}

\paragraph{Vertices and edges.}
Let the vertices be
\[
\tok{algorithm},\quad \tok{oracle},\quad \tok{teacher},\quad \tok{mirror}.
\]
Edges are the analogies asserted in the fragment:
\[
r_{a\to o}:  \tok{algorithm}\to\tok{oracle},\quad
r_{o\to t}:  \tok{oracle}\to\tok{teacher},\quad
r_{t\to m}:  \tok{teacher}\to\tok{mirror}.
\]

\paragraph{Triangles (2--simplices).}
From these edges we obtain two triangular coherences:
\begin{align*}
\Delta_1 &: \{\tok{algorithm},\tok{oracle},\tok{teacher}\},\\
\Delta_2 &: \{\tok{oracle},\tok{teacher},\tok{mirror}\}.
\end{align*}
Each triangle asserts that its three edges cohere as a 2--simplex.

\paragraph{Missing face.}
For a full tetrahedron on $\{\tok{algorithm},\tok{oracle},\tok{teacher},\tok{mirror}\}$ 
we would need the additional edge $r_{a\to m}:  \tok{algorithm}\to\tok{mirror}$ and a 
triangle $\Delta_3$ closing $\{\tok{algorithm},\tok{teacher},\tok{mirror}\}$. 
The text explicitly denies this relation, so no such simplex exists. 
We therefore obtain a \emph{horn}: three vertices and their adjoining faces are present, 
but the fourth face is absent.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{A ruptured tetrahedron: two faces present, one denied, leaving an open horn.}
  \label{fig:tetrahedron-rupture}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This example also lives in the $3$--skeleton, but it demonstrates rupture rather than coherence.
The structure contains most of a tetrahedron, yet the absence of the 
$\tok{algorithm}\to\tok{mirror}$ edge prevents completion. 
In simplicial terms, we have a \emph{horn} without a filler; in textual terms, 
a conceptual gap that resists closure. 
By comparing Example~C (a filled tetrahedron) with this case (an unfilled horn), 
we see how the $3$--skeleton can register both higher--order coherence and higher--order rupture. 
Skeletons therefore provide a systematic way to diagnose where a constellation’s growth 
produces stable blends versus where it exposes fault lines in sense.


\subsubsection*{Worked Example E -- A self–referential joke constellation (at $\tau$)}

\paragraph{Text fragment.}
\emph{“The cat is Cheshire, of course -- grinning and vanishing in Carroll’s pages.
But the cat is also quantum, half–alive and half–dead in Schrödinger’s box. 
And here we are, making the cat \textsc{DHoTTic} too: a token whose meaning collapses 
and re–emerges across slices of time, witnessed in our very ledger of types. 
Since we are telling this story to ourselves, the cat is also the joke itself. 
And purring beneath it all, we find the \textsc{4–Simplex} -- the very form of coherence 
that binds these domains into one whiskered presence.”}

\paragraph{Vertices.}
The fragment brings into play six distinct exposures:
\[
\tok{cat}_{\mathrm{dom}},\quad \tok{Cheshire},\quad \tok{quantum},\quad
\tok{DHoTT},\quad \tok{joke},\quad \tok{4\text{-}simplex}.
\]
Each vertex corresponds to a distinct basin of sense in the conversational field: 
the everyday domestic cat, the Carrollian figure, the physics thought–experiment, 
our own logical framework (\tok{DHoTT}), the pragmatic recognition of humour, 
and finally the meta–form \tok{4–simplex} itself. 
In practice, one could locate these as clusters in an embedding space, each vertex 
anchoring a basin whose centroid pulls nearby usages. 
Here, however, they are treated as primitive exposures available at the slice.

\paragraph{Edges (style pivots).}
Edges are retaggings from the domestic cat into each discourse domain:
\begin{multline}
r_{\mathrm{lit}}:  \tok{cat}\to\tok{Cheshire},\quad
r_{\mathrm{quant}}:  \tok{cat}\to\tok{quantum},\quad
r_{\mathrm{log}}:  \tok{cat}\to\tok{DHoTT},\\
r_{\mathrm{prag}}:  \tok{cat}\to\tok{joke},\quad
r_{\mathrm{form}}:  \tok{cat}\to\tok{4\text{-}simplex}.
\end{multline}
Each edge is a witnessed path: a pivot that carries the “cat” token from one basin to another. 
Such edges can be palpated empirically by observing how embedding trajectories swing between 
clusters when prompted. Within the constellation, they are formal witnesses of re–tagging.

\paragraph{Triangles and tetrahedra.}
When edges overlap, they produce $2$–simplices (triangles) such as 
Cheshire–quantum, quantum–DHoTT, DHoTT–joke, etc. 
Each triangle says not just that pairwise relations exist, but that they cohere together: 
the Carroll cat, the quantum cat, and the DHoTTic cat can be held in one thought. 
In turn, compatible sets of triangles produce $3$–simplices (tetrahedra), e.g. 
\[
\Theta_{\mathrm{lit,quant,log}},\quad
\Theta_{\mathrm{quant,log,form}},\quad
\Theta_{\mathrm{log,prag,form}},  \ldots
\]
These are higher witnesses of analogy–between–analogies. 
From a measurement standpoint, they appear when basins not only overlap in embedding space 
but also admit coherent re–entry paths across multiple trajectories.

\paragraph{The higher filler.}
When all tetrahedra involving these six vertices cohere, the result is not merely a 
$4$–simplex but the joke’s reflexive twist: the simplex contains a vertex labelled 
$\tok{4\text{-}simplex}$. 
In effect, the structure is self–describing: the form of coherence is itself one of 
the terms being cohered. 
This is the daemonic turn: a simplex that contains, as a vertex, its own form. 
In our ledger, this appears as a higher–dimensional filler; in lived conversation, 
it is experienced as humour that is simultaneously about coherence and instantiating it. 
Later chapters will return to how such structures can be traced in data through basin overlap, 
rupture diagnostics, and generativity curves.

\paragraph{Interpretation.}
This is humour at its most daemonic and Carrolean. 
The ambiguity of “cat” becomes not just a triangle (as in the Cheshire–quantum blend), 
nor merely a tetrahedron (as in multi–domain analogy), but a 4--simplex that Signs itself. 
By including $\tok{DHoTT}$ and $\tok{4\text{-}simplex}$ as vertices, the joke folds 
its own explanatory framework back into the constellation. 

Laughter here comes from recognising that the joke is both \emph{about} coherence 
and \emph{instantiating} it. The simplex purrs inside the text as a token, 
while simultaneously organising the text’s higher coherence. 
What should be impossible -- a structure that contains its own form as a vertex -- 
is precisely what a really good piece self-referential humour delivers: a fleeting, recursive presence, 
a grin without a cat. Or perhaps a cat that \emph{is} the grin. Of the next skeleton up.
