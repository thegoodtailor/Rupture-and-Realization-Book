# Plan of Attack — Chapters 6 & 10

**TL;DR (one-liner):**  
**Ch.6:** DHoTT → *naming via corecursion*.  
**Chs.7–9:** time kept to **analogies & experiments only**.  
**Ch.10:** **agency + gronthndeik**, **DAC vs DHoTT**, and the **world-level treatment of time**.

## 1) What goes where

### Chapter 6 — DHoTT → Naming via Corecursion
- Build the move from **DHoTT** to a theory of **naming** using **corecursion** (coinductive structure, observations-as-names).
- Deliverables: a clean pathway (definitions → lemmas → worked example), with emphasis on *how naming arises from corecursive patterns*.
- Guardrail: **no full world/time formalism here**; only hints that will be cashed out in Ch.10.

### Chapters 7–9 — Interlude / Bridge
- **Time:** **deferred**. Restrict to **analogies, metaphors, and small experiments** that motivate the later formalism.
- Purpose: accumulate intuitions and testbeds without committing to a global framework.

### Chapter 10 — Agency & gronthndeik; DAC vs DHoTT; World-Time
- **Agency**: bring agents (and their capacities/commitments) into the formal story.
- **gronthndeik**: introduce and use this scaffold where it belongs—with agency and world-time—rather than earlier.
- **DAC vs DHoTT**: set the comparison *here*, once the world-level/time machinery is available.
- **World treatment of time**: provide the full, explicit treatment (the thing we only alluded to earlier).

---

## 2) Boundaries & Deferrals (to keep us honest)
- **Before Ch.10**: *no* full-blown world/time formalism; keep it to **analogies & experiments** only.
- **Ch.6**: stick to **DHoTT → naming via corecursion**, without importing the agency/world apparatus prematurely.
- **Ch.10**: consolidate: **agency**, **gronthndeik**, **DAC vs DHoTT**, and **world/time** belong here.

---

## 3) Hand-offs & Cross-References
- **From Ch.6 to Ch.10**: the naming/corecursion infrastructure in Ch.6 becomes the substrate on which agency and time-dependent phenomena are expressed in Ch.10.
- **From the interlude (Chs.7–9) to Ch.10**: reference the analogies/experiments as motivating examples that the world-time formalism finally explains.

---

## 4) Micro-checklist
- [ ] Ch.6: DHoTT → naming via corecursion (tight, self-contained).
- [ ] Chs.7–9: only analogies/experiments re: time (no formal world commitments).
- [ ] Ch.10: agency + gronthndeik; **DAC vs DHoTT**; explicit world-level time.
